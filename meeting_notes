1. show algo
2. show bottleneck 
3. make a story about the optimization process:
    a. don't present all 
    b. present a story with major optimizations
    time issue at presentation!


Report:
1. research paper like
    for instance: vector length not divisible. we don't need explanation about that 
    make language crispy

2. memory measurements, roofline etc..

5 pages. double columns 

1.5 pages about background
2-3 pages of only experiments


roofline: by changing it to approximation of exp. then we have instruction mix
no need to hit the roof, but 80-90 percent is reasonable

we can also comparing different types of computation, and brand it as a selling point

don't focus too much on a point which isn't the bottleneck and in consequence 
doesn't give you big speed up, pick low hanging fruits first!


have some prior knowledge of the setting : we have a threshold of cluster size
make different versions of algorithms depend on the distributions

Everyone will answer questions.
Key point: don't miss easy points!!!!!!

10 minutes   10 slides
1-2 minutes introduction, bottlenecks - map to the course material
4-5 munutes about optimization
remaining: showing plots about optimization, why sth. works, why sth. doesn't
            don't show plots which don't make sense.
            if you can't explain it just say we tried a,b,c and still could not find 
            the reason.
