# ASL project: Spectral Clustering

# Benchmarks 

Measures, **the runtime** [cycles] and **the performance** [flops/cycle] of:

## 1. the graph construction

## 2. k-means


fix datasets :  both runtime and perf. for major versions
plot, graph either/and kmeans separately 
growing dim: datasets/6c_5000n (for graph)z
growing k by 1 up to 100:  perf_blobs/growing_k   	(hamerly)
growing n:  do this after a and b (make new based on best k and dim)
